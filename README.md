## FAQ

### What do each of the tiles mean?
Why, that's simple:

 Symbol | Description  |
 :----:  | ------ |
 @      | The entrance to the dungeon.
 #      | A seemingly empty space. Procede with caution.
 $      | Loot! It might be money, a weapon, an artifact, a spellbook, etc.
 %      | A stone wall that reaches from the floor to the cieling.
 ~      | The dungeon's exit! The moonlight shines in from the outside.
